## BioBot Prototype

What is BioBot? A single-player roguelite arena battler with adaptive difficulty, and no "reset to zero" on death. You just keep going. Inspired by [this article](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FabianFischer/20181030/326624/The_Reset_Problem_A_Case_for_Singleplayer_Matchmaking.php).

- A roguelite arena game with monsters, traps, environmental obstacles, and skills (you grow/build over time)
- There's no reset, you die and start a new game and pick up as you were, in a brand new area
- The game transparently tells you what your skill levels are and the delta eg. +1 or -3 this round

## How to Play

- Mouse-over anything to see the name
- Arrow keys to move, bump into stuff to attack, `g` to get items
- `i` to use items (inventory/items)
- If your starting weapon is set to `Bow`, press `f` to aim; auto-targets, mouse to pick a new target; `f` again to fire
- In `prototype/config.json`, you'll find lots and lots (and lots) of things you can tweak to see what style of gameplay you like.
